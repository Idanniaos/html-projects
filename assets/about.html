<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Idannia. I am a computer science major student. My favorite holiday is Halloween 
  because I like to dress up as fun characters and see others do the same. I'm a foodie and I enjoy
  exploring new restaurants on the weekends. I love to travel and enjoy going on roadtrips with family
  and friends. My parents live in Mexico and I try to visit them at least once a year. I live in a small 
  town and I would like to move to a bigger city with more attractions and activities in the next 3 years.
  My hobbies are watching movies, dancing, listening to music, going on walks, trying new foods and trying
  new food recipes.
